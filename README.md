## Insights
1. A total of 292,364 respondents took the survey across 35 countries.
2. Majority of the respondents (118.866) are not aware of the mental health care options. This may be as a result of lack of effective education and communication strategies
3. A significant population of the respondents (232,166) are not willing to grant mental health interview. This indicates that there is a very high rate of stigmatization.
4. 50.49% (147,606) of the total respondents have received treatments or therapy for mental health conditions. This indicates a very high rate of mental health conditions or illness in the populace.
5. Based on the analysis, most of the respondents with treatments experience changes in habits.
6. The percentage of respondents that do not have interest in their work is higher compared to the others. Lack of work interest is another factor that contributes to mental health conditions.

## Conclusion
* By leveraging the data-driven insights derived from this analysis,
1. Healthcare providers, policy makers and all other stakeholders should raise awareness and challenge misconceptions to reduce stigmatization about mental health issues through evidence-based advocacy, education and effective communication strategies.
2. People who have history of mental health conditions or illnesses should be encouraged to engage in work or activities that make them happy.
